To help you write tests using **Jest**, I'll start by extracting the main objectives from the list of tests your supervisor provided. Here's an outline of the tests you need to write based on your **Node.js** application and the testing requirements in the document you uploaded:

### 1. **Load Testing**:
This test assesses the systemâ€™s ability to handle expected user loads. Although typically done with tools like JMeter, you can use `Jest` to mock user loads and test the behavior of your backend API under different conditions.

### 2. **Stress Testing**:
This test evaluates the behavior of the system under extreme conditions. You can simulate extreme scenarios by generating a high number of requests and observing how the application handles them.

### 3. **Endurance Testing**:
This test focuses on the long-term performance of your application, ensuring that the system remains stable over time under continuous load.

### 4. **Data Integrity Testing**:
This ensures the accuracy and consistency of your data across operations like insertion, updates, and retrieval. You will test the endpoints that modify or retrieve data to ensure that the data is processed correctly.

### 5. **Scalability Testing**:
This test will help verify if your application can scale under increasing loads. You can simulate load increments in Jest and monitor the performance of critical endpoints.

Here are some **Jest** test cases based on these categories:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest'); // Assuming you're using express
const app = require('../app'); // Adjust the path as needed
const db = require('../db'); // Mock DB connection if needed

// 1. Load Testing: Simulate a series of requests
describe('Load Testing', () => {
  it('should handle multiple user requests concurrently', async () => {
    const numRequests = 100;
    const requests = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numRequests; i++) {
      requests.push(request(app).get('/api/tickets')); // Adjust endpoint
    }
    const results = await Promise.all(requests);
    results.forEach(response => {
      expect(response.status).toBe(200); // Adjust expected status
    });
  });
});

// 2. Stress Testing: Simulate extreme loads
describe('Stress Testing', () => {
  it('should handle extreme load without crashing', async () => {
    const numRequests = 1000; // Increase the load
    const requests = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numRequests; i++) {
      requests.push(request(app).get('/api/tickets'));
    }
    const results = await Promise.all(requests);
    results.forEach(response => {
      expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    });
  });
});

// 3. Endurance Testing: Run tests for an extended period
describe('Endurance Testing', () => {
  it('should maintain performance over extended periods', async () => {
    const numRequests = 50; 
    for (let i = 0; i < numRequests; i++) {
      const response = await request(app).get('/api/tickets');
      expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    }
  });
});

// 4. Data Integrity Testing: Ensure data consistency
describe('Data Integrity Testing', () => {
  it('should insert and retrieve correct data', async () => {
    const newTicket = { title: 'Fashion Show', price: 100 };
    const postResponse = await request(app)
      .post('/api/tickets')
      .send(newTicket);
    
    expect(postResponse.status).toBe(201);
    expect(postResponse.body.title).toBe(newTicket.title);

    const getResponse = await request(app).get(`/api/tickets/${postResponse.body.id}`);
    expect(getResponse.status).toBe(200);
    expect(getResponse.body.title).toBe(newTicket.title);
  });
});

// 5. Scalability Testing: Simulate increasing load
describe('Scalability Testing', () => {
  it('should scale and handle increased traffic', async () => {
    const initialRequests = 10;
    const subsequentRequests = 100;

    const initialLoad = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < initialRequests; i++) {
      initialLoad.push(request(app).get('/api/tickets'));
    }
    const initialResults = await Promise.all(initialLoad);
    initialResults.forEach(response => {
      expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    });

    const increasedLoad = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < subsequentRequests; i++) {
      increasedLoad.push(request(app).get('/api/tickets'));
    }
    const increasedResults = await Promise.all(increasedLoad);
    increasedResults.forEach(response => {
      expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    });
  });
});
```

### Notes:
1. These tests assume you have `supertest` and `jest` set up in your project.
2. Replace `/api/tickets` with your actual API endpoints.
3. The database interaction may need to be mocked if you are using a real database.
4. These tests are simplistic and are based on the assumption that you want to measure basic response status and data consistency. For more advanced testing, you'd need to integrate performance tools like `Artillery`, `k6`, or `JMeter` for large-scale load and stress tests.
